Example MBH.  Two isoforms very close in unit cell.

Pickle file: mbhresults.pickle.  6672 MBH lattices, already analyzed through
the Diederichs (2017) intensity clustering algorithm.  Average number of 
lattice-lattice matches is 4.4.  Results are embedded in 2D vector space.

The example mbh.py file runs through the mbhresults.pickle, and determines 
clusters from the 2D embedding.
