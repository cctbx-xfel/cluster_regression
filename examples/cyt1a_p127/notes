Cyt1a protein
processing trial 1, re-run as trial 041_rg002 on 11/14/2017
This processing fixes the detector distance (now 371)
No Bravais target is specified, so all cells are in P1
Runs 9 - 47

Tar files in cxi04616/scratch/common/results_cxip12715/r0*/041_rg002/out
tar files untarred into integration pickle files in a separate directory

for f in `find ../../common/results_cxip12715/r0*/041_rg002/out -name "*.tar"`; do echo $f; tar xvf ${f} ; done

there are 2125 pickle files (runs 9-47 have many more, but job did not run to completion due to an unrelated bug)

in directory cluster_regression/examples/cyt1a_p127
for f in `find /reg/d/psdm/cxi/cxi04616/scratch/sauter/p127 -name "*.pickle"`; do libtbx.python summarize_cells.py ${f} ; done

THE HEXAGONAL CELL WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY is about
65, 65, 140, 90, 90, 120.

Very approximate.  The indexer did NOT use a target cell, without which the resulting cells are 
quite inaccurate.
