Cyt1a protein
processing trial 1, re-run as trial 041_rg002 on 11/14/2017
This processing fixes the detector distance (now 371)
No Bravais target is specified, so all cells are in P1
Runs 9 - 47

Tar files in cxi04616/scratch/common/results_cxip12715/r0*/041_rg002/out
tar files untarred into integration pickle files in a separate directory

for f in `find ../../common/results_cxip12715/r0*/041_rg002/out -name "*.tar"`; do echo $f; tar xvf ${f} ; done

there are 2125 pickle files (runs 9-47 have many more, but job did not run to completion due to an unrelated bug)

in directory cluster_regression/examples/cyt1a_p127
for f in `find /reg/d/psdm/cxi/cxi04616/scratch/sauter/p127 -name "*.pickle"`; do libtbx.python summarize_cells.py ${f} ; done

THE HEXAGONAL CELL WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY is about
65.63, 65.63, 166.24, 90, 90, 120. (P6122)

Unfortunately the quality of the clustering may be very poor.  The data represent the "discovery" 
phase in XFEL analysis where we give no target symmetry for the Bravais lattice, 
so many indexing solutions are complete nonsense.  

Nevertheless we eventually solved this structure by molecular replacement in a 
hexagonal cell, P6122, with a=65.63, c=166.24.  It is conceivable that there 
are also other crystal forms in the mix, but we have no evidence of this so far.
